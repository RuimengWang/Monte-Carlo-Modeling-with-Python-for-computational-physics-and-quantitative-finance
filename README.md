# Monte-Carlo-Modeling-with-Python-for-computational-physics-and-quantitative-finance
An ongoing project about using Monte Carlo algorithm for computational physics(Phase transitions, computational nano science, etc) and quantitative finance.Combining this one and my former project: A toy project of Linear Regression is even enough to start a tiny hedge fund!
